## OS 

Sits between the user and hardware. 

Effectively provides a virtual machine to each user. 

- Much easier for user to write code

The virtual machine interface can stay the same across different hardware.
- Much easier for user to write portable code which works on different hardware.

Operating system can coordinate/share access to resources between users. (Like with CSE)

Operating systems can provide privileges/security.
