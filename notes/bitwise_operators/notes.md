## Left shift

By left shifting by 1, we multiply value by 2^i where i is number of shifts. 

Shift only with unsigned types. 

## Right shift 

Do the opposite of left shit and divides by powers of 2. 

Shifts involving negative values are not portable (implementation defined). 

Always use unsigned values/variables to be safe/portable.
